I have held several managerial positions and am currently a Co-Founder and Services Director at Fortitude Limited, a company that provides Accounting, Tax Advisory, Real Estate &amp; Facilities Management Services.  

My background in Finance Mobilization, Accounting  and Property Management—day-to-day operations of business investments—gives me an advantage over the average commercial manager, as most of them have not spent any time ‘in the trenches’ and don’t fully understand what it takes to make that net operating income grow each quarter.

I saw a need for affordable Real Estate Management  and Accounting services, and the opportunity to leverage my experience and replicate it in my own Company hence the incorporation of Fortitude Limited - www.FortitudeLtd.com  . Fortitude Ltd has an experienced and efficient team that serves with a Passion.

I have a wealth of extensive experience of over 10 years in Business Administration, Accounting and Finance Mobilization, Management of Real Estate Facilities.

I specialize in the following areas and may help you with;

✔ Accounting and Financial Reporting.
✔ Tax Advisory.
✔ Property &amp; Facilities Management.
✔ Loan &amp; Project Financing or Re-Financing Mobilization.
✔ Costs Minimization and Profit Maximization for Businesses.

148,"Same business practices that worked in the past, may not be enough to supply today&#39;s new incoming consumers. The advancements of technology give today&#39;s business owners as well as consumers an edge that consumers of the past never experienced. We are currently undergoing a transition in generations. The new generation is replacing the exiting generation known as the baby boomers. It will be an even trade of 80 million baby boomers for 80 million millennials. The new generations way of life is completely different to the latter generation. The Millennial Consumer is the first all digital generation ever. The Millennial wants everything now, if your not gonna give it to them someone else will. Satisfying the needs of this new generation will take precedence on every business&#39;s agenda. Technology is innovating in a way that will allow humans to advance as a race more than ever. There is no reason to over complicate little things systems could simply do better. In this new era the human mind has expanded due to information and technology. In order to accommodate for every human need known to man, we will use technology to spear head these problems. This is truly the time to embrace change and bring in the new ideas in order to revolutionize our country to continue to be a world leader in business.

I build capacity.

I am developing an online tourism company to service the needs for SE Asia with a global reach and focusing my Valuation skills on Cash Flow &amp; Hospitality properties.

I am a director for two Australian small growth companies that provide consumer and security services. All the companies are automated so my direct input is minimal.

My claims to fame include taking one of the companies from zero to being listed in Australia&#39;s top 20 fastest growing businesses for 3 years (top 10 for 2 of the 3 years) running as per the Australian BRW magazine&#39;s Fast100 list. I also have sponsored/project managed/ facilitated the visits over the last five years of surgeons coming to Vietnam to perform free operations on more than 225 children from remote and rural locations, while also training local doctors in &#39;new&#39; procedures.  In 2012 I was invited to present, by the Australian Government in Vietnam, the annual lecture to Australian Alumni of Graduate studies .

Prior work experience&#39;s include, Senior Manager of Research for a large international Real Estate consulting firm, University Lecturer, CEO of a &#39;eco-green&#39; company that was floated on the share market, Business trainer/project manager/consultant for Travel, Healthcare &amp; FMCG industries, and a licensed builder as well as more than 3 years in Real Estate as an agent and associate broker.

A business should concentrate on the things it does better than anyone else.  We are experts at helping healthcare providers function effectively in the ever-changing world of electronic health records.  

A successful EHR experience has two components - the software itself and the relationship a practice has with its vendor.  Neither, on its own, is sufficient.  My primary objective is to help practices understand the difference between the value-added services MICA Information Systems provides vs. most other EHR vendors.  As a smaller company, we are establish personal relationships with our clients.

195,"Radiation Therapist for the past 10 years with experience in University Hospital settings, Regional cancer centers, and independently owned free standing clinics. For the past 2 years I have also taken on the role of Chief therapist and Dosimetrist in training. I have had the opportunity to participate in several American Society for Therapeutic Radiation Oncology conventions as well as other similar learning opportunities.
In the past two years I have developed new skills as an application trainer providing instruction to many places across the United States and more recently in different parts of the world from my origin including Israel, Japan, and Russia. The experience so far has been wonderful and has expanded my view as I find myself needing to adjust to new surroundings.
Continuing on that train of thought I am reminded of a saying Dean Bonner at the College of Health Related Professions in Syracuse NY has said numerous times and that is &quot;Having your vocation be your avocation.&quot; and this is where I find myself now after many years of valuable but trying experience. As I execute my professional duties I am also &quot;studying abroad&quot; learning from colleagues in other parts of the world.","[{""study"": ""Certification&#44; Facilitation and communication"", ""institution"": ""Mary Gober International""}, {""study"": ""A.A.S&#44; Radiation Therapy Technology"", ""institution"": ""Upstate Medical University""}, {""study"": ""A.A.S&#44; Radiation Therapy Technology"", ""institution"": ""State University of New York Upstate Medical University""}]","[{""skill"": ""Clinical Research""}, {""skill"": ""Planning""}, {""skill"": ""Plannning""}, {""skill"": ""Medical Imaging""}, {""skill"": ""PACS""}, {""skill"": ""ARIA""}, {""skill"": ""Medical Devices""}, {""skill"": ""X-ray""}, {""skill"": ""Treatment Planning""}, {""skill"": ""Treatment""}, {""skill"": ""Radiation""}, {""skill"": ""Linear Accelerators""}, {""skill"": ""PowerPoint""}, {""skill"": ""Clinical""}, {""skill"": ""Software Documentation""}, {""skill"": ""Mosaiq""}, {""skill"": ""Hospitals""}, {""skill"": ""Stereotactic Radiosurgery""}, {""skill"": ""EMR""}, {""skill"": ""Cancer""}, {""skill"": ""Capital Equipment""}, {""skill"": ""Radiation Therapy""}, {""skill"": ""Dosimetry""}, {""skill"": ""Microsoft Excel""}, {""skill"": ""Oncology""}, {""skill"": ""Excel""}, {""skill"": ""Word""}, {""skill"": ""Training""}, {""skill"": ""Healthcare""}, {""skill"": ""Radiation Safety""}, {""skill"": ""Microsoft Word""}, {""skill"": ""IGRT""}]","[{""position"": ""Staff Radiation Therapist"", ""company"": ""2004           Hematology - Oncology Associates""}, {""position"": ""Chief therapist/Dosimetrist"", ""company"": ""Radiation Oncology Services P.C.""}, {""position"": ""Application Consultant RT NE"", ""company"": ""Brainlab&#44; Westchester, Illinois""}, {""position"": ""Staff Radiation Therapist"", ""company"": ""United Health Services""}, {""position"": ""Application Trainer - Northeast"", ""company"": ""Brainlab&#44; North east United States""}, {""position"": ""Radiation Therapist"", ""company"": ""Upstate Medical University&#44; Upstate  Medical University Hospital""}]"

As Head of Identity Management, Fraud and Loss Prevention practice, she’s a critical spearhead of CompuLynx’s expansion into the rest of Africa on the practice Identity Management, Fraud and Loss Prevention. “Heading that practice across Africa means a huge task of ensuring that all verticals under these this is covered,” she says. The client list includes those in the NGOs (especially the UN), Education, Banking and Government.

However, evidence of just how much CompuLynx valued Chaula’s contribution was that she rejoined as Head of Strategy, now fully focused on Identity Management, Fraud and Loss Prevention.

Chaula takes pride in being the one who infuses African culture into CompuLynx’s sophisticated work machinery. “My work is to put forward the best image of CompuLynx as a Kenyan company,” she says. Her responsibilities include the initiation and coordination of action plans to penetrate new markets, performance and development of Identity Management Solutions, Customer Relations Management and facilitation of communication between CompuLynx’s workers, customers and suppliers.

 Proven ability and  flexibility to work with clients at executive, managerial and professional levels, in a range of functional specialties and industries. Taking clients on a personalized journey through all points of engagement to seek solutions for their pain points. 

Every client is creative, resourceful and whole.  Sustainable performance comes when people internalize what is new, make it their own and participate fully in the improvement effort. But this is NOT what most people have in mind. They want an answer - turnkey solution. For strictly technical problems this might seem reasonable. More often than  not ; we find  ourselves  dealing with human systems, and human systems are not amendable to technical solutions. Human systems are complex and require more than cause-and-effect solution. The resolution requires a change in thinking.

265,"My specialty is helping organizations achieve exceptional results within a surprisingly short time through highly-productive conversations. Working closely with my clients, I design and facilitate working sessions that keep people actively engaged, regardless of location or time zone. 

Using “blended facilitation,” or a combination of methods and tools, people can participate in multiple ways, at different times, or at the same time. 
Navigating through cross-cultural tripwires and working across time zones is a special area of focus.

Clients like Greenpeace International, Statoil, Medco Health Solutions and IBM also come to Guided Insights when they need customized training and consulting programs to help boost performance of their teams around the world. Areas of expertise include facilitation skills training (both face-to-face and virtual, as well as a blending), cross-cultural communications, virtual team leadership, remote collaboration, planning effective virtual meetings, strategic planning workshop design, and managing performance from afar.

I’m based in Boxborough, Massachusetts (just 35 miles outside of Boston and 20 miles from Worcester), and my clients are scattered throughout New England, across North America, and in Europe and Asia. 

My new book, Leading Effective Virtual Teams: Overcoming Time and Distance to Achieve Exceptional Results, was published by CRC Press in December 2012.

 We&#39;re a bit different to our competitors (the word &#39;disruptive&#39; has been used). Our sole focus is on building a product that helps recruitment companies grow revenues: this means a big focus on pipeline, search and analytics. 90% of our revenues are reinvested straight back into R&amp;D, which means we can innovate faster than any other vendor in the market. We spend precisely $0.00 on marketing- no snazzy sales offices, no expense accounts. We put our customers&#39; success before everything else. 

As Head of Sales and Marketing of Vincere and founding member of HRBoss, I’ve helped both companies grow from zero to multi-million dollar companies. I love my job and the journey that we (my team and all our customers) are on right now with Vincere. I speak to owners of recruitment firms all over the world and I find it fascinating. 

Superpowers: acquisition marketing (content, growth engineering, performance, SEO, email, inbound), product marketing, value propositions, branding, PR. Decent (copy)writer, time permitting.

 *T-then able to combine unique conventional machining skills gained by advancing into CNC final machining of the United States Navy&#39;s Mark VI Nuclear Missile Guidance System TEAM within the 1980&#39;s timeframe for GE- Naval Ordnance.
 *E-even though this GE Defense Division was not to be part of GE&#39;s vision of the 1990&#39;s, marking the end of the cold war, it enriched me to advance into product development within our GE-Plastics World Headquarters TEAM, also situated in Pittsfield,Ma 
 *A-along came the new millenium , coinciding with two monumental changes within General Electric and the US; the departure of longtime CEO John Welch, as well as the escalating importance of the new &quot; Green World Initiative &quot;, ushered in by newly tabbed GE CEO Jeff Immelt. Consequently, GE -Plastics/Specialty Materials didn&#39;t fit into that plan. A winning challenge , as I found myself once again formatting advancing machining skills within GE&#39;s fine Aviation Division TEAM of Clarendon, VT.
*M-many great GE Division TEAMS, one very openminded precision machinist with a confident attitude of maintaining the TEAM spirit for a bright future!

321,"It is very exciting to be in the world of IT as you get to see your customers&#39; views, vision and directions first hand. You see CHROs and CIOs very passionate about what they do which translate into transformation that is out of the box, disruptive and unconventional. 

You see without disruption there are no waves to sail as a calm sea is not good for any sailor. Once you have a clean cut view of what your customers want to attain, you are driven by their passion to deliver and execute in alignment with their goals. The journey may not be smooth and easy, but it&#39;s definitely worth growing and rowing together despite many difficulties. This is how trust is built and relationship is born.

You become your customer&#39;s voice and consultant. You become the customer. You cease being you for a while. You cease being your own organization. Because it&#39;s not about who you are, it&#39;s all about the value of transformation you bring. It&#39;s all about the customer. This is about the People - the TALENTS that keep your customers&#39; business going. 

Transformation is inevitable. Even our country needs it today.

324,"Time and again, I hear executives complaining about a lack of good talent. I strongly believe that good talent can be found everywhere, you just have to know how to identify it.

Using psychometric profiling, I can help job seekers to accurately validate their potential and help employers to recognise it; taking experience and subjective impressions out of the equation.

Based on psychological principles and previously tested at JTI (Japan Tobacco International) in Vietnam, my methodology is adaptable and reliable, returning superior performance outcomes every time. Whether for selection or development, I can customise testing, training or coaching to enhance performance and trigger professional growth. 

With a professional history that comprises over 25 years’ experience for a diverse range of multi-faceted industries, I appreciate every position, in every industry, and at every organisational level. 

Reach out if you&#39;d like to talk psychology, business or talent development; if I can&#39;t help you, I&#39;ll try and put you in touch with somebody who can.

I believe that anyone willing, ready and available can be upskilled. In the 21st century, change is the only constant. The need for 21st century skills has never been more critical. Learning is growing and growth is change. Change is evolution, transformation, survival, thriving!

Leon Megginson (and not Charles Darwin), aptly put it, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most adaptable to change.” Any business/person that does not change will die! I believe in disruption, it makes life-long learning the new normal!

604,"Last 5 years were a tremendous journey in analysis field for me. I have found my interest in area of numbers crunching. I just like it. Simply as that. They can actually tell you the whole story if you can read them properly and know what your business is about. 

Education in Finance and Accounting field gave me discipline and business approach to every analysis that I do. I can back it up with 3 years of experience in Finance Controlling department where I started while still studying. Working Monday to Friday and studying on weekends helped me develop my time management and organizational skills. There is no better training than delivering results on time and then leaving work to study because on Saturday you have an exam.

Thankfully, while still in Poland I had exposure to senior management as I was main financial presenter of all our projects in the company. That made me understand totally different perspective when your recipient has more years of experience than you in total. P/L analysis, revenue, margin, product pricing, budgeting, forecasting. You can count me on that.

Then I moved to London. No job lined-up. No market knowledge. I have never even been there as a tourist. Being pushed against the wall works for me. I found a job in one of the best agencies in advertising world. I was SAP expert that guided non-finance people through mists of the system changes.

My last career encounter is a Business Analytics in one of the most admired companies in the world. I diverted slightly from finance to big data and data analytics. I geared up with additional skills and system knowledge while still staying in numbers dimension. I get to know SAS, Salesforce and Tableau.

After work I run my personal blog about work, motivation and living in London. I want to get it growing so I am educating myself in marketing.

Excellent Wall Street pedigree, where I learned how to read financial statements backwards, a much 
more efficient technique because of the large amount of data, which I was required to analyze on a 
daily basis. 

My responsibilities included block trading, merger arbitriage &amp; hostile corporate take-overs. 

My unusual &quot;medical education&quot; came from playing over 2,500 rounds of golf with over 100 different

Audio is an international language. I am  often quoted in  high-end audio forums under the pseudonym, 
Dr. Ears. 

My greatest strength?  Negotiation  

My biggest weakness?  Spelling
