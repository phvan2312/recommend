Knowledge and culture can spread faster if one is wiling to teach and talk to others rather then just indicating references.","study: Summer Program&#44; German / Hisitory, institution: Ulm University ; study: Entrepreneurship/Entrepreneurial Studies, institution: SEBRAE - Empretec ; study: Technician&#44; Electronics, institution: Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica Celso Suckow da Fonseca ; study: Electrical and Electronics Engineering, institution: Hochschule Mannheim ; study: Master&#44; Telecomunications, (Optical Fiber Communications, Raman Amplifier, Simulation), institution: Universidade Federal Fluminense ; study: Engineer&#44; Telecomunications, Electronics, Computer Science, institution: Universidade Federal Fluminense",LaTeX ; Java ; Optical Amplifiers ; JavaScript ; Research ; Lua ; Non-linear Effects in Fiber Optics ; Visual Studio ; Matlab ; UML ; Python ; Digital Signal Processing ; Microsoft SQL Server ; Raman Amplifiers ; C ; Linux ; C++ ; Simulation ; C# ; Software Development ; Design Patterns ; Software Engineering ; Embedded Systems ; Fiber Optics ; Electromagnetics ; Haskell ; Agile Methodologies ; Simulations ; Telecommunications ; Operating Systems ; Wave Propagation,"work: Techiesse&#44; Niterói, Rio de Janeiro - Brasil, position: Owner, desc: - Solutions design and implementation in the field of electrical engineering and software.

I am developing an online tourism company to service the needs for SE Asia with a global reach and focusing my Valuation skills on Cash Flow &amp; Hospitality properties.

I am a director for two Australian small growth companies that provide consumer and security services. All the companies are automated so my direct input is minimal.

My claims to fame include taking one of the companies from zero to being listed in Australia&#39;s top 20 fastest growing businesses for 3 years (top 10 for 2 of the 3 years) running as per the Australian BRW magazine&#39;s Fast100 list. I also have sponsored/project managed/ facilitated the visits over the last five years of surgeons coming to Vietnam to perform free operations on more than 225 children from remote and rural locations, while also training local doctors in &#39;new&#39; procedures.

Document Management ; work: Sales Director, Prepaid Solutions - Money Network - NSS Sales - First Data Corp&#44; Arizona, Utah, Colorado &amp; North Central USA, position: Sales Director, Prepaid Solutions - Money Network Solutions - First Data, desc: I help employers reduce the costs of issuing and administering paper checks—for all employees, including those without a bank account or those who opt out of direct deposit. The processing of company-issued paper checks can be extremely costly for companies—particularly when 60 million adults are either unbanked or underbanked. To remain competitive, it’s become essential to reduce payroll expenses and streamline operations while providing a viable solution to employees.

The Money Network® Payroll Distribution Service allows you to achieve 100% electronic pay across your organization even for exception pay, termination pay and employees without bank accounts.

Employees can choose between direct deposit or the Money Network Service, which allows employees to access their pay with the Money Network™ Check and the Money Network® Card.

*Simplify Termination Pay
Employers, especially those with high turnover rates, need a simple, timely and compliant way to pay final wages to terminated employees. In fact, some states mandate that termination pay be settled immediately, which can increase your administrative burden and costs.
The Money Network Instant Payment Solution helps you make payments to all terminated employees, even those not currently participating in the Money Network Payroll Distribution Service. Final wages are paid electronically using a Money Network Check drawn on the employer’s Corporate Funding Account. Employers can provide immediate pay at termination.

*Achieve 50 State Compliance
 Payroll distribution laws are complex everywhere in the nation. It’s critical to have a payroll provider to help navigate, review and monitor the legal requirements from state to state.

 Proven ability and  flexibility to work with clients at executive, managerial and professional levels, in a range of functional specialties and industries. Taking clients on a personalized journey through all points of engagement to seek solutions for their pain points. 

Every client is creative, resourceful and whole.  Sustainable performance comes when people internalize what is new, make it their own and participate fully in the improvement effort. But this is NOT what most people have in mind. They want an answer - turnkey solution. For strictly technical problems this might seem reasonable. More often than  not ; we find  ourselves  dealing with human systems, and human systems are not amendable to technical solutions. Human systems are complex and require more than cause-and-effect solution. The resolution requires a change in thinking.

265,"My specialty is helping organizations achieve exceptional results within a surprisingly short time through highly-productive conversations. Working closely with my clients, I design and facilitate working sessions that keep people actively engaged, regardless of location or time zone. 

Using “blended facilitation,” or a combination of methods and tools, people can participate in multiple ways, at different times, or at the same time. 
Navigating through cross-cultural tripwires and working across time zones is a special area of focus.

Clients like Greenpeace International, Statoil, Medco Health Solutions and IBM also come to Guided Insights when they need customized training and consulting programs to help boost performance of their teams around the world. Areas of expertise include facilitation skills training (both face-to-face and virtual, as well as a blending), cross-cultural communications, virtual team leadership, remote collaboration, planning effective virtual meetings, strategic planning workshop design, and managing performance from afar.

I’m based in Boxborough, Massachusetts (just 35 miles outside of Boston and 20 miles from Worcester), and my clients are scattered throughout New England, across North America, and in Europe and Asia. 

My new book, Leading Effective Virtual Teams: Overcoming Time and Distance to Achieve Exceptional Results, was published by CRC Press in December 2012.

&quot; Dansk Industri predicts in the report that Africa could become the world leaders in economic growth over the next five years as a result of a growth in private consumption, especially by Africa’s middle class – which will account for around one third of a predicted population of two billion in 2050. This would account for a market of more than 10 trillion kroner.

Copenhagen Cleantech Cluster, a network for cleantech businesses, told Politiken that Danish companies should work together to provide more comprehensive solutions to the African consumers. The network currently co-operates with Danish companies exporting to African countries like Senegal.&quot;

285,"Vincere is the CRM/ATS for ambitious recruitment firms. If you&#39;re interested in growing your recruitment business, then speak to us. If increasing revenues isn&#39;t a &#39;thing&#39; for you in 2017, then stick with your current CRM. 

 We&#39;re a bit different to our competitors (the word &#39;disruptive&#39; has been used). Our sole focus is on building a product that helps recruitment companies grow revenues: this means a big focus on pipeline, search and analytics. 90% of our revenues are reinvested straight back into R&amp;D, which means we can innovate faster than any other vendor in the market. We spend precisely $0.00 on marketing- no snazzy sales offices, no expense accounts. We put our customers&#39; success before everything else. 

As Head of Sales and Marketing of Vincere and founding member of HRBoss, I’ve helped both companies grow from zero to multi-million dollar companies. I love my job and the journey that we (my team and all our customers) are on right now with Vincere. I speak to owners of recruitment firms all over the world and I find it fascinating. 

Superpowers: acquisition marketing (content, growth engineering, performance, SEO, email, inbound), product marketing, value propositions, branding, PR. Decent (copy)writer, time permitting.

321,"It is very exciting to be in the world of IT as you get to see your customers&#39; views, vision and directions first hand. You see CHROs and CIOs very passionate about what they do which translate into transformation that is out of the box, disruptive and unconventional. 

You see without disruption there are no waves to sail as a calm sea is not good for any sailor. Once you have a clean cut view of what your customers want to attain, you are driven by their passion to deliver and execute in alignment with their goals. The journey may not be smooth and easy, but it&#39;s definitely worth growing and rowing together despite many difficulties. This is how trust is built and relationship is born.

You become your customer&#39;s voice and consultant. You become the customer. You cease being you for a while. You cease being your own organization. Because it&#39;s not about who you are, it&#39;s all about the value of transformation you bring. It&#39;s all about the customer. This is about the People - the TALENTS that keep your customers&#39; business going. 

Transformation is inevitable. Even our country needs it today.

I believe that anyone willing, ready and available can be upskilled. In the 21st century, change is the only constant. The need for 21st century skills has never been more critical. Learning is growing and growth is change. Change is evolution, transformation, survival, thriving!

Leon Megginson (and not Charles Darwin), aptly put it, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most adaptable to change.” Any business/person that does not change will die! I believe in disruption, it makes life-long learning the new normal!

The founders – Dr. Tim Thabe, Dr. Daniel Bartsch and Christoph Maichel – have known each other since their student days at University of Mannheim in the 1990s. Our respective careers span different positions within the financial services sector and as a result we have accumulated profound market and sector insights. We spotted a structural weaknesses in credit supply as banks are increasingly retrenching from lending to small and medium sized (SME) companies. This harms the development of these important businesses and has a negative impact on the overall economy.
In 2014 we decided to execute on our vision to find a better way to lend to SME´s and founded creditshelf. In 2015 creditshelf, the professional market place for SME loans, goes live.

604,"Last 5 years were a tremendous journey in analysis field for me. I have found my interest in area of numbers crunching. I just like it. Simply as that. They can actually tell you the whole story if you can read them properly and know what your business is about. 

Education in Finance and Accounting field gave me discipline and business approach to every analysis that I do. I can back it up with 3 years of experience in Finance Controlling department where I started while still studying. Working Monday to Friday and studying on weekends helped me develop my time management and organizational skills. There is no better training than delivering results on time and then leaving work to study because on Saturday you have an exam.

Thankfully, while still in Poland I had exposure to senior management as I was main financial presenter of all our projects in the company. That made me understand totally different perspective when your recipient has more years of experience than you in total. P/L analysis, revenue, margin, product pricing, budgeting, forecasting. You can count me on that.

Then I moved to London. No job lined-up. No market knowledge. I have never even been there as a tourist. Being pushed against the wall works for me. I found a job in one of the best agencies in advertising world. I was SAP expert that guided non-finance people through mists of the system changes.

My last career encounter is a Business Analytics in one of the most admired companies in the world. I diverted slightly from finance to big data and data analytics. I geared up with additional skills and system knowledge while still staying in numbers dimension. I get to know SAS, Salesforce and Tableau.

After work I run my personal blog about work, motivation and living in London. I want to get it growing so I am educating myself in marketing.

audio and medicine. 

Please contact me before you make your first mistake.

Excellent Wall Street pedigree, where I learned how to read financial statements backwards, a much 
more efficient technique because of the large amount of data, which I was required to analyze on a 
daily basis. 

My responsibilities included block trading, merger arbitriage &amp; hostile corporate take-overs. 

My unusual &quot;medical education&quot; came from playing over 2,500 rounds of golf with over 100 different 
Florida physicians sitting next to me in a golf cart. 

Audio is an international language. I am  often quoted in  high-end audio forums under the pseudonym, 
Dr. Ears. 

My greatest strength?  Negotiation  

My biggest weakness?  Spelling

Searching for a new job and a new community of friends, which includes relocation.
