{"basics":{"name":"Corey Chetcuti, LEED GA","label":"I have a PASSION for Architecture and Design!  Another PASSION of mine is the Environment. These life-long PASSIONS have led me to a B.A. in Interior Architectural Design, a LEED GA accreditation and an  A.S. in Landscape Architecture. I am currently pursuing a LEED AP accreditation.\n\nIn 2011, I was fortunate to become a two-time Gold medal winner at The San Francisco Flower and Garden Show. Winning the CLCA medal and a &quot;Garden Creator&quot; Gold. This Award Winning Sustainable\/Green design was a group effort. The team members: Tina Jauregui, Kim Leichner, Leslie Peluso and myself. \n\nSpecialties: My designs incorporate clean, well thought out living environments based on my clients needs and lifestyle, with sustainability and green design as the main focus. Drought tolerant plants and wildlife habitat are also at the forefront of my designs.","profile":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/corey-chetcuti-leed-ga\/"},"work":[{"company":"Birch River Design&#44;
