{"basics":{"name":"Jeff Reals","label":"Radiation Therapist for the past 10 years with experience in University Hospital settings, Regional cancer centers, and independently owned free standing clinics. For the past 2 years I have also taken on the role of Chief therapist and Dosimetrist in training. I have had the opportunity to participate in several American Society for Therapeutic Radiation Oncology conventions as well as other similar learning opportunities.\nIn the past two years I have developed new skills as an application trainer providing instruction to many places across the United States and more recently in different parts of the world from my origin including Israel, Japan, and Russia. The experience so far has been wonderful and has expanded my view as I find myself needing to adjust to new surroundings.\nContinuing on that train of thought I am reminded of a saying Dean Bonner at the College of Health Related Professions in Syracuse NY has said numerous times and that is &quot;Having your vocation be your avocation.&quot; and this is where I find myself now after many years of valuable but trying experience. As I execute my professional duties I am also &quot;studying abroad&quot; learning from colleagues in other parts of the world.","profile":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jeff-reals-21a14532\/"},"work":[{"company":"Brainlab&#44; Westchester, Illinois","summary":"Application Consultant RT NE","desc":"","startDate":"Nov 2016 ","endDate":" Present "},{"company":"Brainlab&#44; North east United States","summary":"Application Trainer - Northeast","desc":"Provide training for the use of specialty equipment for the use of patient positioning and immobilization and treatment planning to Radiation Oncology clinicians that include physicians, therapists, dosimetrists, etc.","startDate":"Mar 2012 ","endDate":" Present "},{"company":"Radiation Oncology Services P.C.","summary":"Chief therapist\/Dosimetrist","desc":"Effected the expansion and completion of a full-service radiation oncology center through the implementation of a CT scanner and planning system, that included accessory software and hardware components for record and verify, and quality assurance testing. \nMaintain the clinical services currently provided to the local community, as generated by the physicians.\nTrain therapists and physicians on programs and applications.\nDuties include CT simulations, CT quality assurance testing (daily and monthly), planning system data record and verify, server management, treatment device fabrication, patient treatment, patient record development and maintenance.\nWorking toward CMD license over the past 2 years.\nIMRT and 3D treatment planning","startDate":"Nov 2005 ","endDate":"Feb 2012"},{"company":"2004           Hematology - Oncology Associates","summary":"Staff Radiation Therapist","desc":"Performed treatment services, as well as simulations and treatment device production, for patients.\nBuilt treatment charts and maintained patient documentation of services.","startDate":"Jun 2004 ","endDate":"Aug 2005"},{"company":"Upstate Medical University&#44; Upstate  Medical University Hospital","summary":"Radiation Therapist","desc":"Staff therapist.
