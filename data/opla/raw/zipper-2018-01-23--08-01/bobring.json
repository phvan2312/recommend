{"basics":{"name":"Bob Ring","label":"I have a passion for finding solutions for clients.  My background (25 years of Customer Service management) taught me that Customer Service and Sales go hand-in-hand.\n\nA business should concentrate on the things it does better than anyone else.  We are experts at helping healthcare providers function effectively in the ever-changing world of electronic health records.  \n\nA successful EHR experience has two components - the software itself and the relationship a practice has with its vendor.  Neither, on its own, is sufficient.  My primary objective is to help practices understand the difference between the value-added services MICA Information Systems provides vs. most other EHR vendors.  As a smaller company, we are establish personal relationships with our clients.   The comments at the end of the case study below are a nice testimonial about the work we did for Hearts for Hearing, a Hearing and Speech center in Oklahoma City.\n\n\n","profile":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/bobring\/"},"work":[{"company":"MICA Information Systems, Inc.&#44; Winston-Salem, NC","summary":"Product &amp; Services Consultant, Certified EHR Technology and Billing Services","desc":"MICA Information Systems is healthcare I\/T company, specializing in electronic medical records software implementation, cloud-based data hosting, and 3rd party medical billing and collections services.
