{"basics":{"name":"Dan Constein","label":"My professional career path started out of high school with joining the United States Air Force as an enlisted military police officer for six years and then translated that experience to the defense contractor security sectors with Lockheed Martin corporation and most recently Vencore Inc. holding top secret government clearances. \n\nThe skills I have gained while working within these industries has provided me with leadership and communication qualities that has molded me into an effective and efficient leader in all aspects of workplace functions. My colleagues have referred to me as being innovative, self starting, motivated, goal driven, collaborative, and an all around team player that can produce desired results in any situation.\n\nI made the decision to return to school in 2012 and wanted to become a business professional in which I could utilize my previous career experiences to make an impact with a future employer. Albright College in Reading, PA afforded me with that opportunity and I am a part of the 2016 graduating class in Business Administration. I have found success at Albright with a 3.6 GPA and a strong foundation and interest in business management, marketing and HR functions. \n\nMy goal is to connect with business professionals within my network to pursue a new career in business management in which I can use my prior professional skills along with my newly acquired business management foundations to make a positive difference in an organization.","profile":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/dan-constein-7b42b1a8\/"},"work":[{"company":"Penske Logistics&#44; Reading, Pennsylvania Area","summary":"Load Planner (Supply Chain\/Logistics)","desc":"\u2022 Process customer orders, plan &amp; optimize shipments into loads, tender freight to third-party carriers\n\u2022 Update Transportation Management System with current shipment information.\n\u2022 Provide detailed instruction to various customers &amp; associates from other shifts by phone and e-mail\n\u2022 Provide visibility to management and the customer by tracking, process over-sight, auditing, researching and troubleshooting operational issues or functions.\n\u2022 Complete daily logs and trackers\n\u2022 Handle rate negotiations with carriers on a spot rate basis\n\u2022 Identify cost savings opportunities for the customer\n\u2022 Coordinates with carriers to ensure on-time delivery by tracking trucks for pick-up, estimating times of arrival and delivery, and recovering loads when necessary\n\u2022 Provides load exception investigation and reporting\n\u2022 Weighs alternative financial decisions before taking action\n","startDate":"Jun 2017 ","endDate":" Present "},{"company":"Vencore Inc.","summary":"Security Specialist","desc":"Supervises personnel to ensure all duties are carried out on a daily basis.
