Besides this, I also consult companies in Growth Strategy, M&amp;A, and New Business Development.\n\nPrior to this, over the past 15 years, I have gained diverse experiences in strategic, operational, and entrepreneurial roles. The experience has helped me develop thinking for the long term while focusing on the short term. Structured problem solving, Stakeholder management and Conflict resolution are behavioural traits that have helped me navigate my professional journey. Not only am I comfortable with ambiguity, but also have experience in trying to reconcile conflicting objectives and build consensus on strategic issues at senior levels in the organization.
