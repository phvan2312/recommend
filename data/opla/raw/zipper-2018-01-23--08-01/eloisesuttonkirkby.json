{"basics":{"name":"Eloise Sutton-Kirkby","label":"Vincere is the CRM\/ATS for ambitious recruitment firms. If you&#39;re interested in growing your recruitment business, then speak to us. If increasing revenues isn&#39;t a &#39;thing&#39; for you in 2017, then stick with your current CRM. \n\n We&#39;re a bit different to our competitors (the word &#39;disruptive&#39; has been used). Our sole focus is on building a product that helps recruitment companies grow revenues: this means a big focus on pipeline, search and analytics. 90% of our revenues are reinvested straight back into R&amp;D, which means we can innovate faster than any other vendor in the market. We spend precisely $0.00 on marketing- no snazzy sales offices, no expense accounts. We put our customers&#39; success before everything else. \n\nAs Head of Sales and Marketing of Vincere and founding member of HRBoss, I\u2019ve helped both companies grow from zero to multi-million dollar companies. I love my job and the journey that we (my team and all our customers) are on right now with Vincere. I speak to owners of recruitment firms all over the world and I find it fascinating. \n\nSuperpowers: acquisition marketing (content, growth engineering, performance, SEO, email, inbound), product marketing, value propositions, branding, PR. Decent (copy)writer, time permitting. \n","profile":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/eloisesuttonkirkby\/"},"work":[{"company":"Vincere&#44; Singapore","summary":"Director of Growth","desc":"","startDate":"Aug 2016 ","endDate":" Present "},{"company":"Vincere.io&#44; Singapore","summary":"Director of Sales and Marketing","desc":"Vincere is the CRM\/ATS for ambitious recruitment and staffing firms.\n We are user(You)-centric, dataminded, process driven, mobile enabled and inexpensive.\n Don&#39;t take our word for it, try it for yourself.
