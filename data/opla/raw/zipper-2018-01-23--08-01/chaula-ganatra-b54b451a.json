The 12 years since then have seen her rise up the ranks and notch up miles of impressive and meaningful experience and increased expertise. \n\nAs Head of Identity Management, Fraud and Loss Prevention practice, she\u2019s a critical spearhead of CompuLynx\u2019s expansion into the rest of Africa on the practice Identity Management, Fraud and Loss Prevention. \u201cHeading that practice across Africa means a huge task of ensuring that all verticals under these this is covered,\u201d she says.

A focused and practical-minded visionary. Chaula grew to become Senior Development Manager then Head of Sales Africa. Clear about what she wants, she took a sabbatical for family reasons. It is well-documented all across the world that a big frustration for women in the job market is that they have to manage family and career. However, evidence of just how much CompuLynx valued Chaula\u2019s contribution was that she rejoined as Head of Strategy, now fully focused on Identity Management, Fraud and Loss Prevention.\n\nChaula takes pride in being the one who infuses African culture into CompuLynx\u2019s sophisticated work machinery. \u201cMy work is to put forward the best image of CompuLynx as a Kenyan company,\u201d she says.
