{"basics":{"name":"Cary Maultasch","label":"LinkedIn lover, I frequently comment, post  &amp; write articles on finance, economics, politics, high-end \naudio and medicine. \n\nPlease contact me before you make your first mistake.\n\nExcellent Wall Street pedigree, where I learned how to read financial statements backwards, a much \nmore efficient technique because of the large amount of data, which I was required to analyze on a \ndaily basis. \n\nMy responsibilities included block trading, merger arbitriage &amp; hostile corporate take-overs. \n\nMy unusual &quot;medical education&quot; came from playing over 2,500 rounds of golf with over 100 different \nFlorida physicians sitting next to me in a golf cart. \n\nAudio is an international language. I am  often quoted in  high-end audio forums under the pseudonym, \nDr. Ears. \n\nMy greatest strength?  Negotiation  \n\nMy biggest weakness?  Spelling\n\nSearching for a new job and a new community of friends, which includes relocation.\n\n\n\n\n\n","profile":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/cary-maultasch-39b82117\/"},"work":[{"company":"Self-Employed&#44; Colorado","summary":"Financial Artist","desc":"Financial: I help corporations structure or re-structure to maximize after tax income.
