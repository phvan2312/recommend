{"basics":{"name":"Carol Munene","label":"Brands make the world go round, no, they really do!\n\nIt excites me everyday to be a key player in the &#39;solution wheel&#39; as we help brands deliver their promise to their intended consumers and users in the most innovative and impact-FULL way possible.  As an interface between my Clients and the Agency, I strive to understand my Clients goals thereafter organizing my Creative team and our Administrative team to help the Agency deliver effective campaigns that touch their consumers&#39; hearts and minds. \n\nMy role calls for great organization, agility and creativity to deliver new, timely and exciting campaigns that go beyond the Client&#39;s brief. \n\nIt excites me that I (together with my team) have delivered great campaigns in both light (unrestricted markets) and dark (very restricted markets where direct communication to the Consumer is strictly prohibited). \n\nI love it when my world goes round!
