{"basics":{"name":"Lukasz Ferenc","label":"Last 5 years were a tremendous journey in analysis field for me. I have found my interest in area of numbers crunching. I just like it. Simply as that. They can actually tell you the whole story if you can read them properly and know what your business is about. \n\nEducation in Finance and Accounting field gave me discipline and business approach to every analysis that I do. I can back it up with 3 years of experience in Finance Controlling department where I started while still studying. Working Monday to Friday and studying on weekends helped me develop my time management and organizational skills. There is no better training than delivering results on time and then leaving work to study because on Saturday you have an exam.\n\nThankfully, while still in Poland I had exposure to senior management as I was main financial presenter of all our projects in the company. That made me understand totally different perspective when your recipient has more years of experience than you in total. P\/L analysis, revenue, margin, product pricing, budgeting, forecasting. You can count me on that.\n\nThen I moved to London. No job lined-up. No market knowledge. I have never even been there as a tourist. Being pushed against the wall works for me. I found a job in one of the best agencies in advertising world. I was SAP expert that guided non-finance people through mists of the system changes.\n\nMy last career encounter is a Business Analytics in one of the most admired companies in the world. I diverted slightly from finance to big data and data analytics. I geared up with additional skills and system knowledge while still staying in numbers dimension. I get to know SAS, Salesforce and Tableau.\n\nAfter work I run my personal blog about work, motivation and living in London. I want to get it growing so I am educating myself in marketing.\n\nIf you have challenging opportunity contact me: Lukasz.ferenc0405@gmail.com \n","profile":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/lukasz-ferenc-b3a1b693\/"},"work":[{"company":"American Express&#44; London, United Kingdom","summary":"Business Insights Analyst - EMEA Partner Analytics","desc":"Commercial analytics and reporting leveraging data and insights to drive growth on commercial portfolio.\n\n\u2022\tProduction of Corporate Global Account Reviews for key clients\n\u2022\tEvaluate and quantify the success of Global Account Review reporting\n\u2022\tInput into the long term strategy of Global Account Review reporting\n\u2022\tDevelopment of Sales reporting and market level business insights\n\u2022\tIdentify insight from reports to drive business opportunities\n\u2022\tLeverage best practices from external market and the proprietary business\n\u2022\tUnderstand the level and sophistication of reporting in EMEA Bank Partners\n\u2022\tIndependently working with regional partners\/customers to deliver on custom value analytics &amp; actionable insights\n","startDate":"Oct 2017 ","endDate":" Present "},{"company":"Po Prostu \u0141ukasz&#44; London, United Kingdom","summary":"Owner","desc":"Po Prostu \u0141ukasz is my personal blog (http:\/\/www.poprostulukasz.pl - lang.
