{"basics":{"name":"Alex Herrera","label":"Same business practices that worked in the past, may not be enough to supply today&#39;s new incoming consumers. The advancements of technology give today&#39;s business owners as well as consumers an edge that consumers of the past never experienced. We are currently undergoing a transition in generations. The new generation is replacing the exiting generation known as the baby boomers. It will be an even trade of 80 million baby boomers for 80 million millennials. The new generations way of life is completely different to the latter generation. The Millennial Consumer is the first all digital generation ever. The Millennial wants everything now, if your not gonna give it to them someone else will. Satisfying the needs of this new generation will take precedence on every business&#39;s agenda. Technology is innovating in a way that will allow humans to advance as a race more than ever. There is no reason to over complicate little things systems could simply do better. In this new era the human mind has expanded due to information and technology. In order to accommodate for every human need known to man, we will use technology to spear head these problems. This is truly the time to embrace change and bring in the new ideas in order to revolutionize our country to continue to be a world leader in business.

The unexpected change came after a professor had recommended that I get a job in a place with a great track record.

That is what it&#39;s all about, making the customers day or maybe even their year. Customers are the crown jewel always and forever. Without THEM there is no US.
