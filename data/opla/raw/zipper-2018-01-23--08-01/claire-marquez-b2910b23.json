{"basics":{"name":"Claire Marquez","label":"It is very exciting to be in the world of IT as you get to see your customers&#39; views, vision and directions first hand. You see CHROs and CIOs very passionate about what they do which translate into transformation that is out of the box, disruptive and unconventional. \n\nYou see without disruption there are no waves to sail as a calm sea is not good for any sailor. Once you have a clean cut view of what your customers want to attain, you are driven by their passion to deliver and execute in alignment with their goals. The journey may not be smooth and easy, but it&#39;s definitely worth growing and rowing together despite many difficulties. This is how trust is built and relationship is born.\n\nYou become your customer&#39;s voice and consultant. You become the customer. You cease being you for a while. You cease being your own organization. Because it&#39;s not about who you are, it&#39;s all about the value of transformation you bring. It&#39;s all about the customer. This is about the People - the TALENTS that keep your customers&#39; business going. \n\nTransformation is inevitable. Even our country needs it today. \n\n\n","profile":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/claire-marquez-b2910b23\/"},"work":[{"company":"Oracle&#44; Philippines","summary":"Senior Oracle HCM Customer Advisor","desc":"As David Ulrich mentioned, HR is not HR.

It is about executing transformation to bring about the best in your talents, recognizing them and valuing their contributions in a growing and highly competitive environment. It goes beyond transactional preoccupation. Every engagement and decision has to make an impact to the business and its objectives. It&#39;s hard work. But it&#39;s change-driven. It used to be old school but it&#39;s shifting to more innovative and relevant approaches. And this is part of what I do.
