Taking clients on a personalized journey through all points of engagement to seek solutions for their pain points. \n\nEvery client is creative, resourceful and whole.  Sustainable performance comes when people internalize what is new, make it their own and participate fully in the improvement effort. But this is NOT what most people have in mind. They want an answer - turnkey solution. For strictly technical problems this might seem reasonable. More often than  not ; we find  ourselves  dealing with human systems, and human systems are not amendable to technical solutions. Human systems are complex and require more than cause-and-effect solution. The resolution requires a change in thinking.\n\nSo how do you cultivate a growth mindset if it doesn\u2019t come naturally? And how do you hold onto it if you\u2019ve got it already?","profile":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/joan-chepkemoi-5020aa43\/"},"work":[{"company":"Professional Training and Coaching&#44; East and
